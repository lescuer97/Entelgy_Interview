# Entelgy interview test

A .env file is needed for developing the server and testing, put it at the root of the project.
I will provide this file.

## Observations

1. There is no password field in the client response of the Insurance API.
2. The id parameter in swagger doesn't capture the id input field and sends a string of ":id" instead of the provided ID
